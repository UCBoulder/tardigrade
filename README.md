tardigrade

An implementation of micromorphic continuum mechanics that uses functions and 
values defined in the micromorphic_element repository available using SSH 
from git@bitbucket.org:NateAM2/micromorphic_element.git

The documentation for this implementation detailing the theory is available 
in the micromorphic_element repository as the balance equations and other 
materials are located there.

Questions should be addressed to Nathan Miller who can be reached at
